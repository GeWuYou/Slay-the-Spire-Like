A deck-building, turn-based combat prototype made with **Godot 4** and **C#**, inspired by *Slay the Spire* and built following an intermediate card-game architecture.

This project is a **C# rewrite** of the original GDScript tutorial project.

## 💡 Why Rewrite in C#?

Godot’s C# API provides:

- Better static typing
- Easier large-scale code maintenance
- Familiar .NET ecosystem
- Performance benefits for logic-heavy card systems
- IDE support (Rider / VS / VS Code) with auto-refactor tools
